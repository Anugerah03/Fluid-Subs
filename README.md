# Fluid-Substitution
Fluid substitution is usually used to estimate the state of a reservoir
if the fluid contained in it is replaced by another fluid due to reinjection activity 
naturally or artificially. In this case, future modeling will be made, on porosity previously filled with 70% oil to 100% water
